Henry Izere's Take at Home Project

Introduction:

Welcome to my take at home project submission. This README accompanies my project, where I have addressed three specific technical questions and developed a comprehensive presentation to facilitate an easier understanding during our upcoming meeting.

Project Overview:
The project consists of three main components, each tackling a distinct problem:

1. Grid Seat Occupancy
This part of the project deals with the algorithmic challenge of grid seat occupancy. The details of the approach, including the algorithm's time and space complexities, are elaborated in the presentation and code comments.
Testing: I have added a new file to test the accuracy in finding the number of occupied seats. the file is named ext.txt, it is include in the submission files

2. Shortest Distance Algorithm (Question 3)
In this section, I have developed an algorithm to calculate the shortest distance. To demonstrate its functionality:

Code Structure: The code is thoroughly commented for easy understanding.
Testing: I have included test files - newWord.txt and word.txt. These can be used to test the algorithm, where you can uncomment a line in the code to switch between the files. newWord.txt contains duplicates, while word.txt does not, aiding in testing the dictionary's capability in tracking occurrences and calculating distances accurately.

3. ATM and Banking System Simulation (Section2)
For the final question, I have designed a software solution that simulates the functionality of an ATM and its underlying banking system. All details, including the design and implementation, are included in the section2 of the PowerPoint presentation.

In this section I also made a Python-based code skeleton simulating an ATM and banking system named ATM.py, showcasing object-oriented programming principles. It features a modular design with classes representing ATM components (e.g., cash dispenser, keypad) and operations (e.g., deposits, withdrawals). 

Presentation:
The PowerPoint presentation is a key part of this submission, providing a visual and structured explanation of my solutions. Each section of the presentation corresponds to the respective question in the project.

Conclusion:
I have endeavored to create comprehensive solutions for each posed question, ensuring clarity in code and thoroughness in testing. I look forward to discussing these in detail during our meeting.
